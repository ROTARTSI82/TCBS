Totally Customizable Battle Simulator
------------------------------------
By Grant Yang


Totally Customizable Battle Simulator is a multiplayer strategy video game.
You can design and program your own soldiers and make them fight against your
friend's soldiers.

TCBS is inspired by Totally Accurate Battle Simulator
by Landfall. It uses Pygame 1.9 and Python 2.7 but
still works in Python 3. TCBS also uses PodSixNet
written by chr15m (Chris McCormick).

PodSixNet for python3.4 by tborisova (Tsvetelina Borisova)
is also used so that some multiplayer features work in Python 3.
However, trying to connect to a Python 3 server using a Python 2 client
(And vice versa) will result in an exception.
