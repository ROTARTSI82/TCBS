TOTALLY CUSTOMIZABLE BATTLE SIMULATOR a21.18.04.14
------------------------------------------------------------------------
By Grant Yang

Totally Customizable Battle Simulator is a multiplayer
strategy videogame. You can design and program your
own soldiers and make them fight against your
friend's soldiers. It is inspired by Totally Accurate
Battle Simulator by Landfall and uses Pygame 1.9 and
Python 2.7. TCBS uses PodSixNet written by chr15m (Chris McCormick).
